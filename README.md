NOTE: In order to run scheduler.jar, please use the path to JRE 1.8 in UG4. By default, "java -jar scheduler.jar" will use JRE 1.7 - and will throw an UnsupportedClassVersion Exception. Therefore, in order to run the scheduler, please use the following command to run the scheduler.jar file:

/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.8.0_45/bin/java -jar scheduler.jar [input file] [no of processors] [OPTIONS]
